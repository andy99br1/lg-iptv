/* ── Per-title audio & subtitle memory ───────────────────────────────────────
   Track choices used to be remembered once, globally: one "preferred subtitle"
   and one "preferred audio language" for the whole app. That is the wrong shape
   for a library. A dubbed film and a subtitled one want opposite settings, and
   an anime episode with a Japanese track and English signs has nothing in
   common with the English-language film watched before it — so every title
   silently inherited the last one's choice, and turning subtitles off for one
   film turned them off for everything.

   So the choice is now keyed by TITLE (`m:<id>` / `e:<id>` — the same key
   Continue Watching uses), which is what makes "this series always in Japanese
   with subs" stick per series while leaving everything else alone.

   The old global keys are kept as a FALLBACK rather than dropped, and are still
   written on every pick. That is deliberate and not just migration cover: a
   title played for the first time has no memory of its own, and starting it
   from what the user reaches for everywhere else is a much better guess than
   starting it from the stream default. Per-title memory wins whenever it
   exists; the global is only consulted when it doesn't.

   ES5, and read defensively — a corrupt or full localStorage must degrade to
   "no memory", never to a player that won't start. */
